```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Problem 1
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

### 1.Write a short description of the dataset.
This dataset contains `r nrow(ny_noaa)` rows and `r ncol(ny_noaa)` columns, including seven variables: `id` (weather station id), `date` (date of observation), `prcp` (total daily precipitation), `snow` (snowfall), `snwd` (snow depth), `tmax` and `tmin` (min and max temperature).

### 2.Do some data cleaning. 
```{r}
ny_noaa_clean <- ny_noaa |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(tmax = as.numeric(tmax), tmin = as.numeric(tmin))
```

- For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?
0 is the most commonly observed value for snowfall, because most days of the year, it does not snow in NY.
```{r}
ny_noaa_clean |>
  count(snow) |>
  arrange(desc(n))
```
